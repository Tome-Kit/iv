<h1><em> Waste it on me </em></h1>
<h2><em> BTS ft. Steve Aoki</em></h2>
<p>
You say love is messed up<br/>
You say that it don't work<br/>
You don't wanna try, no, no<br/>
(You don't wanna try, no, no)<br/>
And baby, I'm no stranger<br/>
To heartbreak and the pain, of<br/>
Always being let go (Always being let go)<br/>
</p>
<p>
And I know there's no making this right, this right<br/>
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Your mind)<br/>

But we both found each other tonight, tonight<br/>
So if love is nothing more<br/>
Than just a waste of your time<br/>
